Nifty code snippets and code kata exercises

## General notes

While choosing ECMAScript 6 as a language of choice for a project in 2019 may seem like a weird choice, keep in mind that main 
purpose of offered exercises is to prepare you for curated coding exercises, which often occur in environments that are unlikely
to support either TypeScript or latest and greatest ECMAScript version, hence ES6, which runs pretty much everywhere, was chosen.
