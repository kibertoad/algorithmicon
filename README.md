Code kata exercises and useful code snippets (monoku)

## General notes

While choosing ECMAScript 6 as a language for a project in 2019 may seem weird, keep in mind that main 
purpose of offered exercises is to prepare you for curated coding exercises, which often occur in environments that are unlikely
to support either TypeScript or latest and greatest ECMAScript version. Due to this reason, ES6, which runs pretty much everywhere, was chosen.
