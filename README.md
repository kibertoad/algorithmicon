Code kata exercises and useful code snippets (monoku)

## How to use

### Code kata

Find section that you are interested in within `code-kata` section of the repository, fill in implementation within appropriate
`*.js` file, and check correctness of your implementation by running accompanying `test.js` file!

### Code monoku

Browse `code-monoku` for useful techniques!

### Complexity lab

* Check `complexity-lab/docs/cheatsheet.md` for quick refresher on Big O notation;

* Tinker around with code in `complexity-lab/experiments` to get better feeling of how different types of time complexity
manifest. Run `test.js` accompanying different experiments to see how provided implementation execution time reacts to size
of inputs ramping up.

## General notes

While choosing ECMAScript 6 as a language for a project in 2019 may seem weird, keep in mind that main 
purpose of offered exercises is to prepare you for curated coding exercises, which often occur in environments that are unlikely
to support either TypeScript or latest and greatest ECMAScript version. Due to this reason, ES6, which runs pretty much everywhere, was chosen.
